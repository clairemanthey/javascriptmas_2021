JAVASCRIPTMAS 2021!!!

Daily JavaScript coding challenges during the month of December. Challenges ranged from simple to complex with stretch goals to practice JavaScript skills. Simple challenges included creating lists from user input, building a count down timer, more complex challenges included using a API to get dessert ideas and speedometer to calculate how fast Santa'a reindeer are flying, while styling each to look appealing to users.
